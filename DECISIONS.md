# DECISIONS.md - Non-obvious choices and their rationale

Format: **Decision** - rationale, and rejected alternatives.

## D1. Repo name
Attempting `parquet` (Celtics floor + columnar-data nod) per brief. Fallbacks in
order: `hardwood-ledger`, `glasshouse-hoops`. Final name recorded in README.md.

## D2. Stack confirmed as briefed, versions pinned by scaffold
Next 16.2.12 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4,
Zod 4, Vitest 4. (No LLM SDK: the analyst speaks OpenAI-compatible HTTP - see D17.)
Tailwind v4 uses CSS-first config (`@theme` in globals.css), not `tailwind.config.js`.

**Pinned Prisma 6 (6.19), not the freshly-released Prisma 7.** Prisma 7 removed
`url = env("DATABASE_URL")` from the datasource block, requiring a `prisma.config.ts`
plus a driver adapter passed to the client. That directly contradicts the brief's
"use a DATABASE_URL env var" + "trivial Postgres swap" requirements and adds
setup/runtime risk for zero v1 benefit. Prisma 6 keeps the exact env-var model the
brief specifies (swap `provider` + `DATABASE_URL` to move to Postgres). Rejected:
adopting Prisma 7's adapter model (more moving parts, less battle-tested).

## D3. Charts hand-rolled as inline SVG (no chart library)
The brief allows "a lightweight library or hand-rolled SVG." Chose hand-rolled.
Rationale: total control of legibility at 390px, zero bundle cost, no dependency
churn, and our charts (age curve, value-over-time, pick capital) are simple enough.
Rejected: Recharts/visx - heavier, harder to make truly thumb-legible, and their
defaults fight our editorial aesthetic.

## D4. Valuation model does NOT use Sleeper stats/projections
Brief flags them as unreliable. v1 model inputs: Sleeper `search_rank` (a decent
consensus proxy that ships free with `/players/nba`), age curve, `years_exp`,
role stability (`depth_chart_order`), injury status, and **league-specific
positional scarcity computed from the actual `scoring_settings`**. A `StatsProvider`
interface isolates any future real stats source (a free external stats API preferred) behind
a fixture so the model can be upgraded without touching callers. Transparency, not
accuracy, is the stated differentiator - every weight lives in `lib/valuation/config.ts`.
Rejected: building on Sleeper stats (unreliable per brief); blocking on a stats API
key (violates NEVER BLOCK).

## D5. Build our own transparent value model (market exists but is thin)
Research (RESEARCH.md §4) **refuted** the "no crowdsourced NBA value market exists"
hypothesis: a few genuine crowd-vote NBA value sites do exist. But all of them are
low-liquidity (the leading one displayed "0 data points collected"), and the
"values derived from real executed trades" approach is entirely unoccupied for the NBA.
Aggregating a thin, unreliable market would inherit its noise. So Phase 3 ships a
**transparent internal model** with a published `/methodology` page - framed as "beat
the thin incumbents on transparency," not "invent a category." Crowd voting is
explicitly a post-v1 feature (it needs participation we can't bootstrap at launch).
Rejected: scraping those sites' values (proprietary, thin, and against project rules);
blocking on building a crowd market first.

## D6. Trade evaluator outputs a thesis, not a letter grade
Per product thesis. Output = what each side is betting on, the single assumption
that must hold for the user, and what the user's own history says about this kind of
bet. A letter grade is explicitly what competitors ship; we do not.

## D7. Analyst is a prompt over a text corpus - not fine-tuning, not a vector DB
~20-40 transactions/season × 3-5 seasons of annotated history fits in one context
window. Implemented as a single well-constructed adversarial prompt. System prompt
lives in `lib/analyst/system-prompt.ts` with a comment naming sycophancy as the
primary failure mode. Degrades to a deterministic rules-based summary when no LLM is
configured; the rest of the app needs no key.

## D8. Player images abstracted behind `<PlayerAvatar>`; monograms by default
Default = generated monogram avatars in team colors (no licensing concern, looks
intentional). Real photos behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_PLAYER_PHOTOS`, which now **defaults ON** (D21).
**Source: Sleeper's own CDN keyed by `player_id`**
(`sleepercdn.com/content/nba/players/thumb/{id}.jpg`). Empirically, Sleeper's `/players/nba` returns
a null external-provider id for every NBA player, so third-party headshot CDNs are unusable. Not every
player has a Sleeper image (some 403/404), so `<PlayerAvatar>` is a client component
that falls back to the monogram on load error. Licensing caveat: these headshots
aren't licensed for redistribution; the flag is opt-in for personal/local use only
(Eric confirmed private use). Background removal not needed (CDN images are already
cleanly cropped). Rejected: third-party headshot CDNs (no usable id); bundling raster assets.

## D9. FixtureProvider built FIRST; still the zero-dependency path
Guarantees no UI work is ever blocked on network/API, and all tests run against it.
`LEAGUE_PROVIDER` selects the provider (`fixture` | `sleeper` | `csv`).
**Superseded in part by D21:** the default is now `sleeper`, and `fixture` is an
explicit opt-in. See D21 for why.

## D10. Prisma with a Postgres-portable schema
SQLite for local dev via `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"`. Avoided SQLite-only types:
JSON blobs stored as `String` (stringified) rather than a native Json column, all
ids `String`, timestamps `DateTime`. Swapping `provider = "postgresql"` + a Postgres
`DATABASE_URL` is the only change needed. Raw transaction payloads persisted as
stringified JSON so re-derivation never needs a re-fetch.

## D11. Decision-ledger annotations keyed by Sleeper `transaction_id`
Annotations are stored locally (DB) against the immutable `transaction_id`, so
re-ingests never orphan them. Transaction bodies are also persisted, so the ledger
works offline and against fixtures.

## D12. "New transaction" detection via diff of persisted transaction_ids
Ingest is idempotent (upsert by `transaction_id`). The set of transaction_ids with
no annotation and `type in (trade, notable)` drives the home-screen "unannotated
decisions" badge.

## D13. Ingest sweeps weeks 1..25 per season
NBA fantasy weeks empirically run ~1-22. Sweeping to 25 with empty-tolerance is
safely idempotent and future-proofs longer seasons/play-in weeks.

## D15. Design system - dark editorial "parquet", not default shadcn
Committed to a specific aesthetic (financial terminal × sports magazine): near-black
surfaces, one sharp gold accent, Fraunces serif display + Inter + JetBrains Mono for
data. Fixed bottom tab bar with icons+labels, no floating overlays, stacked cards
(the exact opposite of the competitor's mobile mistakes catalogued in RESEARCH §2C).
Full tokens in DESIGN.md. Rejected: installing shadcn's default component look
(generic SaaS); a chart library (hand-rolled SVG instead, D3). Note: shadcn's utility
deps (cva/clsx/tailwind-merge/lucide) are used, but the visual system is bespoke.

## D16. Lazy `ensureIngested()` so a fresh clone needs no manual ingest
The app reads the corpus from the DB, but `ensureIngested()` populates it on first
read if empty. Against fixtures this means `pnpm dev` alone works (no ingest step);
`pnpm ingest` remains the explicit, idempotent path for real Sleeper data. Rejected:
requiring a manual ingest before the UI works (violates "runs end to end with zero
external dependencies"); reading the corpus live from the provider on every request
(a call storm for Sleeper).

## D17. Analyst is provider-agnostic and free/open-source by default
Eric ruled out a paid Anthropic key ("we must find an open source or free
alternative"), so the analyst now speaks to **any OpenAI-compatible
chat-completions endpoint over plain `fetch`**, configured with `LLM_BASE_URL` /
`LLM_API_KEY` / `LLM_MODEL`. That covers free hosted open models (Groq, OpenRouter)
and fully local ones (Ollama, LM Studio) with the same code path, and it removed the
`@anthropic-ai/sdk` dependency entirely. Absent any config it degrades to the
deterministic audit, so the app ships with zero keys and no vendor lock-in.
Rejected: bundling a local model (Vercel serverless can't host one); an Ollama-only
integration (would not work in production).

## D18. Reads are DB-free; the database is optional
Eric deploys on Vercel, where SQLite cannot persist. The corpus is therefore read
live from the provider (Sleeper fetches cached, players memoized in-process), so every
read feature works with no database at all. The DB is used ONLY to persist ledger
annotations, and even that is best-effort: if it is unreachable the write returns
`persisted: false` instead of erroring. Rejected: requiring Postgres to deploy (a
setup wall for a private app); localStorage-only annotations (lost across devices).

## D19. Do not guess the pick component of commissioner trades
Commissioner-executed trades always carry `draft_picks: []`, so their pick component
is unrecoverable. Inferring it from the timestamp-less `traded_picks` snapshot was
implemented, tested against the real league, and **rejected**: it attributed six
unrelated pick hops spanning three seasons to a single 2023 deal, because the only
available signal ("both parties are in this trade") is far too weak. Fabricating trade
contents is worse than an acknowledged gap, especially for a product whose entire
premise is an honest record. Unattributable hops surface separately via
`unrecordedPickMoves()`, and anything inferred is labelled "(inferred)" in the UI.

## D20. Tilt signal (trades after a loss) left fixture-only
Deriving it live requires ~110 matchup requests and measured ~15s of cold start.
It demonstrably works (1232 matchups, 4 managers flagged), but Eric judged "panic
after losses" not a question worth answering, so we don't pay the latency on every
request. `loadMatchups()` has a one-line switch to re-enable. Consequence: two awards
self-omit on live data. Rejected: paying 15s on every cold start for an unwanted read;
deleting the code (the derivation is sound and cheap to re-enable).

## D14. Season labeling
Sleeper labels the league by the calendar year the season ends is ambiguous; Sleeper
uses the start-year convention we mirror verbatim from the `season` field. We never
compute season; we read it.

## D21. Zero-config deploy serves the REAL league (default flipped to `sleeper`)
The Vercel deployment silently served synthetic demo data, because `LEAGUE_PROVIDER`
defaulted to `fixture` and `.env.local` is (correctly) gitignored, so production had
no env vars at all. Plausible-looking fake data is a worse failure than an error:
nothing in the UI said "this is not your league."

Fixed by making the real league the default. The league id and username are committed
constants (`DEFAULT_SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID` / `DEFAULT_SLEEPER_USERNAME` in
`lib/providers/index.ts`), so a deploy with **zero** environment variables loads NSL
Fantasy Hoops. `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_PLAYER_PHOTOS` likewise defaults ON, since it is
inlined at BUILD time and a forgotten var would otherwise ship monograms with no
visible cause. `LEAGUE_PROVIDER=fixture` is now the explicit opt-in to the offline
demo, and the demo banner was made loud and unmissable rather than a small tag.

Consequence: tests had to pin `LEAGUE_PROVIDER=fixture` in `vitest.config.ts`, because
several reach a provider and would otherwise start making real HTTP calls (this
actually happened - the suite went from 0.3s to 20s and 11 tests timed out).
Rejected: documenting the env vars harder (the failure mode is silent, so docs don't
prevent it); throwing when unconfigured (a broken deploy is worse than a working one).
